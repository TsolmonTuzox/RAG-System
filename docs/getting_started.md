# Sample Document: Getting Started with RAG System

## Overview
This document demonstrates how the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system processes and indexes documents for intelligent retrieval.

## Key Features

### Document Processing
The system can process various document formats:
- Markdown files (.md)
- PDF documents (.pdf)
- Word documents (.docx)
- Plain text files (.txt)

### Semantic Search
Our semantic search capability allows you to:
- Find relevant information using natural language queries
- Retrieve contextually similar content
- Get accurate answers based on your document corpus

### API Integration
The system provides RESTful APIs for:
- Document upload and processing
- Chat interactions with context
- Custom validation rules
- Historical data retrieval

## How It Works

1. **Document Ingestion**: Upload your documents to the system
2. **Chunking**: Documents are split into manageable chunks
3. **Embedding**: Each chunk is converted to vector embeddings
4. **Storage**: Embeddings are stored in a vector database
5. **Retrieval**: Queries trigger semantic search across embeddings
6. **Generation**: LLM generates responses using retrieved context

## Example Use Cases

- **Knowledge Base Q&A**: Answer questions from your documentation
- **Technical Support**: Provide context-aware technical assistance
- **Research Assistant**: Find relevant information across documents
- **Compliance Checking**: Validate data against custom rules
